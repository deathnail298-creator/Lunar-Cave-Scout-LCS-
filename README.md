Lunar Cave Scout (LCS)

Disposable Free-Flight Lava Tube Scout — Phase 0

Purpose

LCS is a slow, conservative, disposable free-flight scout designed to map lunar lava tubes without ever touching the surface. Its job is simple:

get inside the tube

stay alive long enough to map meaningful geometry

get data back out

die gracefully if needed

Mission value is data returned, not drama.

What LCS Is

a micro-spacecraft in a cave

deliberately boring, methodical, cautious

cheap enough that multiple units are expected

designed for partial success to still be useful

focused on mapping + environmental sensing, not operations

What LCS Is Not

LCS does not burrow
LCS does not drive
LCS does not “heroically explore”
LCS does not require precision piloting
LCS does not become infrastructure

Contact with walls, floor, or ceiling is failure, not a feature.

Core Operational Doctrine (Phase 0 Lock)

Free flight, strictly off-surface at all times

Slow movement > safe navigation > useful data

Drops breadcrumb communication repeaters as it progresses

placement does not need to be precise

objective is connectivity, not elegance

If comms degrade → keep going until unsafe

If comms fail completely → store data onboard

If environment becomes uncertain or unsafe → stop, transmit, accept termination

Multiple LCS units are the reliability strategy, not one hyper-optimized machine

Vertical / Steep Shaft Doctrine

Vertical transitions are explicitly high-risk. Behavior is:

Slow down before descent

Heavily scan before committing

Drop an extra repeater at the rim

Treat verticals as high-reward but acceptable loss zones

If descent appears unrecoverable → record, transmit, end mission with dignity

Why This Exists

NASA and contractors need real geometry and real environmental truth inside lava tubes. Robots that try to “do everything” fail expensively.

LCS exists to:

be cheap enough to risk

be disciplined enough not to die stupidly

return enough data to justify the next mission

allow teams to send three or five, not one flagship vehicle

Phase 0 Boundary

This is a Phase 0 concept:

Defines mission intent

Locks operational doctrine

Establishes constraints

Clearly states non-claims

No mass budgets.
No parts catalogs.
No fantasy engineering.

Permission to exist, nothing more.

Phase 0 Success Criteria

Phase 0 is successful if:

The system is clearly understood.

The doctrine prevents over-claiming.

It can be handed to an engineering team without confusion.

Reviewers can instantly see its purpose and its restraint.

Licensing

Phase-0 and Phase-1 use policy applies:
Free to read, analyze, study, discuss, and prototype.
Commercialization requires license.

Single-Sentence Summary

LCS is a disposable, free-flight lunar lava-tube scout that moves slowly, stays strictly off-surface, maps the environment, drops crude repeaters to keep talking, and counts useful returned data as success—even if it never makes it all the way in.
