09 — License & Execution Guardrails

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 0

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines:

how LCS Phase-0 material may be used,

what freedom it intentionally grants,

what boundaries protect it,

and what rules apply when someone wants to move beyond thinking and into execution.

This ensures:

ideas can spread,

engineering communities can reason freely,

and commercialization is handled responsibly and fairly.

2. Philosophy

This project deliberately supports:

learning

analysis

discussion

research

non-commercial prototyping

healthy engineering thinking

It deliberately does not support:

uncontrolled commercial appropriation,

quiet corporate absorption,

“free labor for someone else’s product,”

or misrepresentation of this work as unrestricted.

Simple rule:

Thinking is free. Commercializing is not.

3. What You May Do — Without Payment or Permission

You are explicitly encouraged to:

read this project

study its doctrine

analyze and critique it

reference it in academic or research work

discuss it in public or private

build non-commercial prototypes

run simulations

conduct experiments

use it for teaching, education, or research

include non-commercial explorations in papers, labs, or internal technical reviews

If you are:

a student,

a researcher,

a space nerd,

a NASA/JPL/ESA/industry engineer exploring ideas internally,

or a team doing pre-commercial feasibility thinking,

you are welcome here.

You do not owe money for Phase-0 thinking.

4. What Requires Licensing

A license is required when LCS:

becomes part of a funded mission program

is included in a commercial development effort

enters paid contract work

becomes mission baseline concept

is implemented beyond internal research curiosity

transitions to Phase-2 / Phase-3 execution inside an organization

is used as the basis for government-funded engineering development

is incorporated into a corporate product roadmap

becomes a working fielded system

or is otherwise monetized or institutionalized

If money, institutional deployment, procurement, contract value, or mission execution becomes involved, licensing is required. Period.

If you’re unsure?
Assume you need a license and contact the project owners.

5. No Silent Commercial Extraction

This project explicitly rejects the quiet corporate strategy of:

cloning open concepts,

sanitizing attribution,

absorbing them internally,

commercializing,

and pretending it was “developed independently.”

That behavior is out of bounds.

If you intend to:

build real hardware based on this,

pitch it as part of a funded program,

or deploy derivative operational systems,

then do it ethically:
→ engage, license, and give credit.

Organizations honoring that will have our support.
Organizations attempting silent extraction will not.

6. Integrity of Doctrine

If you implement an LCS-like system commercially or operationally:

You must respect the locked Phase-0 doctrines or clearly declare deviation.

Doctrine integrity matters:

strict off-surface philosophy

expendability intent

conservative behavior

disciplined comms philosophy

honest risk posture

If someone builds a reckless platform that violates doctrine but still labels it “LCS,” that is misrepresentation.

If you want to deviate, fine —
then it is not LCS. Call it something else.

7. Attribution Expectations

Non-commercial use:

attribution appreciated

not legally required

Commercial / institutional / mission use:

attribution required

license required

Plain, honest attribution:

name the project,

don’t pretend you invented it in-house,

acknowledge the upstream source.

This isn’t about ego.
It’s about intellectual honesty.

8. Enforcement Posture

This project prefers cooperation, licensing, and partnership over aggression.
However:

execution rights are real

licensing requirements are real

legal protection exists if required

Organizations attempting to exploit open early-phase work without honoring execution boundaries should not expect tolerance.

This project is open to thinking together, not being exploited.

9. What This Section Is Not

This is not:

a full legal contract

a substitute for a formal commercial license

detailed enforcement policy language

a technical compliance checklist

Formal licensing terms are handled separately when needed.

This document simply sets:

expectations,

boundaries,

ethics,

and intent.

10. Single-Sentence Guardrail Summary

Phase-0 LCS material is free to read, study, debate, and prototype non-commercially — but when it becomes mission, money, product, deployment, or institutional execution, licensing and ethical engagement are required, and doctrine integrity must be respected.
