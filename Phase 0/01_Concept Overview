01 — Concept Overview

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 0

1. Purpose

The Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) is a disposable, free-flight probe designed to map lunar lava tubes from the inside, without ever touching the walls, floor, or ceiling.

Its job is simple:

Enter the tube from a surface rover.

Fly slowly and conservatively.

Map internal geometry and key environmental conditions.

Maintain a communications chain as far as is practical.

Return whatever data it can.

Accept partial exploration and early death as normal outcomes.

Mission value is measured in useful data returned, not in how “deep” the scout gets or how long it survives.

2. Problem Context

Lunar lava tubes are high-value targets for long-term habitat, shielding, and infrastructure. The problem is straightforward:

Surface assets (rovers, landers) can’t safely enter.

Ground robots have a high chance of getting stuck or lost.

Full “hero” missions are expensive, slow, and politically fragile.

We still need basic geometry and environment truth inside these tubes.

The gap: a low-cost way to peek inside, map enough of the tube to matter, and do it in a way that tolerates failure.

LCS is designed to fill that gap with cheap, sacrificial, targeted scouting.

3. High-Level Concept

LCS behaves as a micro-spacecraft in a cave, not a rover, not a hopper, not an anchor.

At a high level:

A surface rover or deployed platform positions at or near the lava-tube entrance.

An LCS unit is released or launched into the tube interior.

Once inside, the LCS:

maintains strictly free-flight (no intentional surface contact),

moves slowly and deliberately,

continuously scans geometry and environment,

drops simple communications repeaters to maintain a link back to the entrance rover,

and adapts its progress based on risk, link quality, and remaining margin.

When conditions become too uncertain or too risky, LCS is expected to prioritize data transmission and survival for as long as useful, then terminate. This is by design.

4. Operating Environment

Baseline assumed environment:

Location: Lunar lava tubes and related subsurface voids.

Lighting: Essentially dark; no reliance on ambient light.

Gravity: Lunar gravity (≈1/6 g), affecting dynamics and plume behavior.

Surfaces: Irregular rock, possible loose regolith, rough walls and ceilings.

Line-of-Sight: Frequently obstructed; comms must bend around corners via relays.

Thermal/EM: No detailed assumptions in Phase 0 beyond “compatible with lunar subsurface conditions.”

Phase 0 does not commit to specific hardware choices (sensors, propulsion type, structure). It defines behavioral doctrine and mission role in this environment.

5. Mission Objectives (Phase 0 Concept Level)

Primary Objective

Obtain actionable internal geometry and environmental data from within lunar lava tubes and deliver it back to surface systems.

Secondary Objectives

Demonstrate that low-cost, disposable scouts can provide meaningful mapping without being treated as flagship assets.

Build a pattern of partial-coverage successes rather than an all-or-nothing, single-hero mission mindset.

Provide enough internal truth to:

inform follow-on missions,

improve hazard models,

refine infrastructure concepts (habitat, storage, shielding).

Non-Objectives (Phase 0)

LCS does not attempt to operate as permanent infrastructure.

LCS does not attempt crew support or logistics.

LCS does not attempt precision manipulation, sampling, or construction activities.

6. Design Philosophy

The core design philosophy is:

Disposable by Intent

Each LCS unit is expected to be lost eventually.

Reliability comes from multiple units, not from trying to make one immortal.

Slow and Conservative

Velocity is intentionally low.

Aggressive maneuvers are avoided.

Geometry is scanned and understood before committing to risky movement.

Strictly Off-Surface

No intentional contact with walls, floor, or ceiling.

Any contact is treated as a failure mode, not an allowed operating mode.

Data-First Evaluation

Success is measured by the quality and quantity of data returned, not by distance traveled.

A mission that maps only the first segment but returns clean, well-structured data is considered successful.

Crude But Reliable Communications Chain

Uses simple, dropped repeaters as it progresses.

Placement is geometry-tolerant: the goal is connectivity, not elegance.

If link quality drops, behavior becomes more conservative.

Graceful Failure

If conditions degrade, LCS prioritizes:

Transmitting what it has.

Maintaining safe posture as long as it can.

Terminating without endangering other assets.

This philosophy keeps the system honest and reviewable. It avoids feature creep and prevents LCS from being reimagined as a rover, lander, or infrastructure node.

7. Role in a Larger Mission

LCS is designed as a tool inside a larger mission stack, not as the centerpiece.

Likely integration pattern:

A rover or fixed platform handles:

deployment at the tube entrance,

power and communications back to orbit/Earth,

storing and forwarding LCS data.

LCS handles:

local free-flight navigation in the tube,

geometry and environment sensing,

relay deployment and localized decision-making.

Downstream consumers (science teams, habitat designers, risk assessors) work with the returned maps and environment profiles to make decisions. LCS is not responsible for interpreting those decisions or executing follow-up infrastructure.

8. Out-of-Scope Claims (Phase 0)

LCS does not claim, at Phase 0:

crewed operations support,

long-term station-keeping or infrastructure roles,

direct sample return,

direct construction or modification of tube interiors,

guaranteed full-tube traversal,

precise quantitative performance metrics (range, resolution, lifetime).

Those are Phase-1+ concerns. Phase 0’s job is to define what LCS is, what it is not, and how it behaves so that later work has a sane spine to build on.
