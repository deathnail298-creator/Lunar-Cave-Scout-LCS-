03 — Operational Doctrine

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 0

1. Purpose of This Doctrine

This document defines how the Lunar Cave Scout behaves once deployed.
It is not hardware-specific and does not prescribe subsystems. Instead, it establishes:

the mission mindset,

movement philosophy,

decision priorities,

communications behavior,

termination discipline,

and the rules that prevent reckless operation.

If anyone builds an LCS that does not behave like this, it is not an LCS.

2. Core Behavioral Mindset

LCS operates under a strict doctrine:

Move slowly. Stay off the surfaces. Gather truth. Protect the data. Leave dignity in failure.

This doctrine prioritizes:

Data value

Survivability margin

Conservative movement

Mission discipline over bravado

LCS is not a bold explorer.
It is a cautious, methodical scout.

3. Movement Philosophy
3.1 Speed Discipline

LCS operates at intentionally low velocities.

momentum is minimized,

deceleration margin is preserved,

response time is intentionally generous,

sudden maneuvers are avoided unless required.

Faster does not equal better. Faster equals dead.

3.2 Commitment Rules

Before committing to forward progress:

geometry must be scanned,

risk must be assessed,

confidence in available escape margin must exist.

Movement should always feel “hesitant but competent,” not aggressive.

3.3 Absolute Contact Avoidance

Contact with interior surfaces is not an “acceptable rough edge of engineering.”
It is a hard failure.

No scraping,

No bracing,

No rolling on floors,

No “controlled bumping,”

No intentional “wall riding.”

A probe that relies on touching to operate is not an LCS.

4. Navigation Discipline

LCS navigation is governed by conservative confidence thresholds.

LCS moves only when:

geometry confidence is acceptable,

control authority is available,

margin exists to handle error,

comms are adequate or onboard storage is stable enough to justify proceeding.

LCS does not:

“press on blindly,”

gamble on luck,

use hope as a strategy.

When in doubt, it:

slows,

stabilizes,

reassesses.

This isn’t heroics. This is disciplined reconnaissance.

5. Communications Doctrine (Summary Reference)

A full communications policy exists in
04_Communications_Chain_Doctrine.md.
This section defines only the operational behavior relationship.

Baseline doctrine:

LCS deploys breadcrumb repeaters as it progresses.

Placement does not need elegance — only effectiveness.

Communications quality influences movement aggressiveness.

Behavioral results:

Good link → cautious progress acceptable.

Weak link → reduce ambition.

Lost link but stored data → continue only if the risk profile justifies it.

The communications state is part of navigation decision priority, not an afterthought.

6. Data Priority Doctrine

LCS exists to create truth, not performance theater.

If forced to choose between:

deeper penetration with risk of total loss,
or

shallow penetration with guaranteed clean data returned,

LCS doctrine chooses:
→ clean, guaranteed data returned

Mission success is not “how far did it get?”
Mission success is, “do we now know something real that we did not know before?”

7. Conservative Success Doctrine
7.1 Acceptable Mission End States

Valid Success

partial mapping + returned data

shallow penetration but rich environmental detail

short mission but flawless data transmission

Valid Failure With Value

loss after transmitting partial dataset

comms collapse after relays but stored dataset survives

Unacceptable Failure

reckless penetration leading to catastrophic early crash

loss with no meaningful returned data

violation of off-surface doctrine

8. Vertical / Hazard Zone Behavior

Hazard-dense environments (vertical shafts, tight turns, collapses) require elevated discipline.
Detailed rules live in:

05_Vertical_Geometry_Doctrine.md

Summary principles:

slow dramatically,

over-scan before commitment,

bias toward survival over bravery,

accept mission boundary if risk becomes unacceptable.

A dead LCS returns zero science. Partial mapping returns value.

9. Termination Doctrine

LCS does not fear termination. It plans for it.

When:

uncertainty rises,

geometry becomes unknowable,

control authority is threatened,

survivability collapses,

or comms + storage converge toward unrecoverable risk,

LCS is expected to:

Prioritize transmission of stored data.

Maintain stability as long as meaningfully possible.

Accept termination deliberately rather than crashing chaotically.

Graceful termination is a valid, professional mission outcome.

10. Multi-Unit Doctrine

LCS is designed under the assumption that missions may deploy multiple units.

This fact influences doctrine:

LCS does not carry the emotional burden of “must do everything.”

LCS does not take reckless risks “because this is our only shot.”

Mission architecture resilience comes from fleet redundancy, not suicidal bravery.

If one dies but returns meaningful truth → mission value achieved.
If several operate conservatively and iteratively → compounding knowledge achieved.

11. Human / Governance Alignment

This doctrine gives:

mission managers predictability,

safety stakeholders confidence,

engineers guardrails,

science teams usable truth rather than heroic anecdotes.

It avoids ego-driven mission behavior and favors disciplined reconnaissance.

12. Single-Sentence Doctrine Summary

LCS behaves as a slow, cautious, strictly off-surface free-flight scout that only moves when confident, values returned truth over distance traveled, adapts behavior to comms and risk, and terminates with discipline rather than gambling on survival.
