02 — System Boundaries & Non-Claims

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 0

1. Purpose of This Document

This document draws a clear, enforceable box around what the Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) is allowed to be and what it is explicitly not.
Its job is to:

prevent misinterpretation,

stop scope creep,

protect the integrity of the Phase-0 concept,

and ensure downstream engineering teams stay on doctrine.

If a capability is not inside these boundaries, it does not exist in Phase 0.

2. System Identity Boundary

At Phase 0, LCS is defined as:

A disposable, slow, strictly off-surface, free-flight scout designed to map lunar lava tubes and return useful data, with success measured by actionable data returned rather than total traversal or mission duration.

That is the identity. Everything derives from that.

3. Physical Interaction Boundary

LCS operates under a strict off-surface mandate.

Allowed

Free flight

Passive proximity operations

Navigation in open void space

Not Allowed

Ground contact

Wall contact

Ceiling contact

Anchoring

“Brushing” or “tapping”

Intentional collision-assisted stabilization

Any contact with interior surfaces is treated as failure, not functionality.

No marketing spin. No pretending impact is “just another operating mode.”
Contact = failure. This keeps the doctrine honest.

4. Mission Role Boundary

LCS is a scout, not a worker, not an infrastructure node, not a hero platform.

Allowed Mission Role

Reconnaissance

Mapping

Environmental sensing

Communications breadcrumb deployment

Returning data until risk becomes unacceptable

Explicitly Not Its Job

Construction

Habitat support

Logistics

Sampling

Tube modification

Long-term service role

Becoming installed hardware

If someone wants those capabilities, that is a different system, not an evolved LCS.

5. Engineering Scope Boundary (Phase 0)

Phase 0 does not define hardware details beyond necessary behavioral doctrine.

Phase 0 Does Include

mission intent

operating philosophy

boundaries

constraints

doctrine

conceptual purpose

Phase 0 Does NOT Include

exact propulsion method

detailed sensor stack definitions

structural materials

thermal architecture

avionics selection

exact comms stack specification

performance guarantees

numerical design commitments

Those decisions belong to Phase-1+ engineering and program partners. Phase 0 exists to give them a clear conceptual spine, not premature engineering fiction.

6. Communications Boundary

LCS uses breadcrumb repeaters because the geometry demands it.
However, Phase 0 does not lock specifics.

Allowed Statements

repeaters exist

placement does not need precision

maintaining connectivity is a goal, not a perfection contest

loss of comms does not equal automatic mission failure if data storage persists

Non-Claims

exact relay type

data protocol

frequency

power model

guaranteed uninterrupted link

The behavior doctrine is locked. The specific technology is not.

7. Risk & Reliability Boundary

LCS is intentionally not a flagship asset.

Explicit Boundary Position

It is designed to be expendable.

It is expected that some will be lost.

System reliability derives from multiple deployed units, not over-engineered immortality.

Partial success is legitimate mission value.

This is not a “hero rover.”
This is a disciplined scouting appliance.

If someone tries to turn LCS into a “one-shot do-everything super robot,” they are violating this doctrine.

8. Success Boundary

LCS is not graded on romantic success.
It is graded on disciplined, useful success.

Counts as Success

partial tube mapping

early termination with returned data

conservative progress that prioritizes survival

documenting only near-entrance geometry but doing it well

Is NOT Required for Success

full tube traversal

maximum range achievement

long mission duration

dramatic state achievements

Mission value is:

“Do we now know something real and actionable we did not know before?”

If yes → success.

9. Environmental Claims Boundary

Phase 0 does not assert:

exact tube dimensions,

dust environment specifics,

electromagnetic challenges,

thermal stability values,

detailed hazard characteristics.

It only assumes:

tubes are dark,

geometry is irregular,

surfaces are dangerous to touch,

comms will not naturally “just work.”

Everything else belongs to future mission analysis.

10. Legal / Licensing Boundary

Phase-0 and Phase-1 materials:

are free to read, study, analyze, discuss, and prototype.

They are not free to commercialize, incorporate into an operational program, or deploy at scale without licensing.

That boundary exists to:

enable proliferation of thinking,

protect execution rights,

keep this doctrine accessible but not exploitable.

(Full legal positioning is in 09_License_&_Execution_Guardrails.md.)

11. Single-Sentence Guardrail Statement

LCS is a disposable, strictly off-surface, free-flight mapping scout whose job is to return useful data from lunar lava tubes — nothing more, nothing less — and any attempt to turn it into a rover, infrastructure platform, superhero robot, or multi-role asset is outside doctrine and out of bounds.
