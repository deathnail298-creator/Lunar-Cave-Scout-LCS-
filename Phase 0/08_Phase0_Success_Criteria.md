08 — Phase 0 Success Criteria

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 0

1. Purpose of This Document

Phase 0 exists to answer a fundamental question:

Does LCS have permission to exist as a serious, credible, disciplined concept?

This document defines how we judge that.
These criteria determine whether Phase 0 is considered complete, valid, and ready for handoff into Phase-1 style engineering thinking.

If these criteria are not met, Phase 0 is not “done,” regardless of how many pages were written.

2. Success Philosophy

Phase 0 is not about:

engineering completeness

hardware selection

technical performance claims

press-release storytelling

Phase 0 is about:

clarity,

discipline,

boundaries,

credible doctrine,

and preventing fantasy from sneaking in.

Phase 0 success =
Clear, enforceable conceptual structure that real engineers can pick up without rolling their eyes.

3. Primary Phase 0 Success Criteria

Phase 0 is successful when the following are true:

Criterion 1 — The System Is Clearly Understood

A technically competent reviewer should be able to answer, without ambiguity:

What is LCS?

What does it do?

What does it not do?

Why does it exist?

How is success defined?

If reviewers debate what LCS “really is,” Phase 0 failed.

Criterion 2 — Boundaries and Non-Claims Are Explicit

There must be strong fences around the concept:

strict off-surface doctrine is unambiguous

clear limits on mission role

explicit refusal to overclaim capability

explicit communication that expendability is intentional

If the concept could be misinterpreted as:

a rover,

infrastructure,

a flagship science vehicle,

or a do-everything robot,

then Phase 0 did not lock hard enough.

Criterion 3 — Operational Doctrine Is Coherent and Disciplined

LCS behavior must read as:

rational,

predictable,

defensible,

conservative,

and professional.

A reviewer should feel:

“This behaves like a serious exploration tool, not a hype toy.”

If doctrine reads emotional, heroic, or “we’ll figure it out later,” Phase 0 failed.

Criterion 4 — Communications Doctrine Is Realistic

Communications must be treated as a first-class operational constraint, not a technical footnote.

Phase 0 succeeds if communications behavior:

acknowledges line-of-sight breakage as reality,

enforces breadcrumb repeater use,

explicitly couples comms quality to movement behavior,

shapes risk posture and decision-making.

If communications reads like hand-waving optimism, Phase 0 failed.

Criterion 5 — Vertical Geometry Doctrine Is Mature

Vertical and steep environments must:

be acknowledged as high-risk,

receive explicit handling rules,

allow disciplined refusal,

and include strengthened communications safeguards.

If verticals are treated casually, vaguely, or “same as everything else,” Phase 0 failed.

Criterion 6 — Risk & Failure Are Treated Honestly

Phase 0 succeeds if:

expendability is embraced, not reluctantly tolerated,

loss is acknowledged as normal,

useful failure is distinct from useless failure,

graceful termination is explicitly doctrinal.

If the document implies “we expect perfection,” Phase 0 failed.

Criterion 7 — Integration Context Is Grounded and Realistic

Phase 0 succeeds if:

LCS is clearly positioned as a mission element, not a standalone mission,

dependencies are acknowledged,

upstream and downstream relationships are defined,

campaign value is recognized.

If LCS is framed like a miracle silver bullet, Phase 0 failed.

4. Evidence of Readiness for Phase-1 Thinking

Phase 0 is considered ready for Phase-1 engineering exploration if:

Engineers can pick this up and say:

“I know exactly what we’re building and what we’re not building.”

Mission planners can say:

“This fits logically inside a lunar campaign.”

Reviewers can say:

“This is disciplined, conservative, and credible.”

No one needs to ask:

“Wait… what did you actually intend this thing to be?”

If Phase 1 starts with confusion, Phase 0 was not successful.

5. Explicit Non-Goals

Phase 0 does not attempt to:

prove feasibility,

guarantee performance,

define engineering tolerances,

choose propulsion,

finalize sensing packages,

specify power systems,

produce CAD,

or justify cost.

Those belong to later work.

Phase 0’s only job is to lock identity, doctrine, discipline, and intent.

6. Single-Sentence Definition of Phase 0 Success

Phase 0 is successful when the Lunar Cave Scout is defined with clarity, constrained with discipline, guided by credible doctrine, integrated realistically into mission context, and protected from hype, overreach, and ambiguity — such that real engineers can responsibly take it forward.
