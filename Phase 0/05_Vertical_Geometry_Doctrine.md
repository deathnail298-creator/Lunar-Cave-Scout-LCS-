05 — Vertical Geometry Doctrine

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 0

1. Purpose of This Doctrine

Vertical and steep geometry inside lunar lava tubes represents the highest-risk operating environment for the Lunar Cave Scout (LCS). This doctrine defines:

how LCS treats verticals and steep descents,

how it approaches and evaluates them,

when it proceeds and when it refuses,

how communications interacts with vertical descents,

how termination decisions are made in these environments.

This document exists so mission teams and engineers cannot “hand-wave” vertical navigation or treat it as a casual extension of normal movement. It is different. It demands discipline.

2. Baseline Truths About Vertical Zones

Phase 0 acknowledges the following operating realities:

vertical shafts dramatically increase accident probability,

vertical geometry reduces recovery options,

loss of control becomes catastrophic quickly,

communications distortion risk increases,

navigation certainty decreases,

stabilization margins shrink.

In vertical environments, risk compounds faster than reward. Doctrine must reflect that.

3. Doctrinal Position

Vertical and steep shafts are explicitly considered high-risk / high-reward mission zones.

This is not subtle language. It is intentional.

Because of that designation:

LCS is expected to treat them cautiously,

LCS is allowed to walk away from them,

mission success does not require conquering them,

partial data is acceptable,

retreat or termination is legitimate and professional.

If someone builds an LCS and treats verticals casually, they are out of doctrine.

4. Approach Behavior

When approaching a vertical or steep gradient:

LCS must:

slow significantly

increase scan density

expand geometry uncertainty margins

stabilize posture

bias toward conservative positioning

LCS should treat the entrance to a vertical shaft like a cliff edge, not an interesting curiosity.

5. Pre-Commitment Scanning Requirement

Before committing to a vertical descent or steep segment:

LCS doctrine requires:

Heavy forward scanning of the early shaft region.

Environmental condition sensing, to the degree Phase-1 hardware enables.

Trajectory feasibility assessment with available control authority.

Confidence evaluation that the mission is not gambling.

If uncertainty cannot be reduced to a disciplined, rational level → LCS does not proceed.

“Let’s see what happens” is not allowed.

6. Extra Repeater Doctrine at Vertical Boundaries

Vertical transitions demand stronger communications resilience.

Therefore:

LCS will drop an additional breadcrumb repeater at or near the vertical transition point.

Purpose:

anchor strong comms at the point of highest decision gravity,

allow robust uplink before entering riskier geometry,

provide a recoverable “edge marker” for ground teams,

create a strong comms baseline if the descent is attempted.

This node is doctrinally intentional. Not optional. Not “nice to have.”

7. Descent Behavior

If LCS does choose to proceed:

Descent must be:

slow,

deliberate,

controlled with margin,

continuously re-evaluated.

During descent:

if geometry confidence weakens → slow further

if control authority margin shrinks → halt and reassess

if comms collapse without storage confidence → bias toward retreat or termination

if mission value vs risk weakens → reconsider descent continuation

Descents are earned, not instinctive.

8. Commitment Thresholds

LCS does not commit to descent simply because:

“we’re already here”

“we want to see what’s below”

“we might miss our chance”

“this could be historic”

Emotional logic has no place here.

Commitment requires:

realistic ability to remain stable,

justified expectation of useful data return,

preservation of data already gathered,

communications chain behavior support,

alignment with expendability doctrine.

If those are not present → the correct doctrinal move is do not descend.

9. Acceptable End States in Vertical Zones
Valid Success

shallow descent + strong mapping + returned data

marking the boundary + transmitting “we got to here”

discovering and documenting that descent is unsafe

extra communications node placement + retreat

Yes—documenting refusal is valid scientific value.
“Here is where vertical danger begins, and here is why it’s unsafe” is real knowledge.

Valid Failure With Value

controlled descent attempt, partial success, then termination after useful data transmission

crash after last clean dataset transmitted

communications loss after successful partial map stored onboard

These are unfortunate, but acceptable under expendability doctrine if discipline was maintained.

Unacceptable Failure

reckless falling

uncontrolled tumble descent

catastrophic loss with zero meaningful data

“we gambled because we hoped it would work”

That is not acceptable.

10. Mission Campaign Perspective

Vertical shafts do not need to be conquered on the first LCS deployment.

Doctrine assumes:

multiple units exist,

future missions may revisit the same shaft,

progressive learning accumulates,

conservative passes feed future confidence.

Campaign discipline > single-shot bravado.

11. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Phase-0 Boundaries Locked

This doctrine locks:

verticals are high-risk by definition

slow, cautious, heavily scanned approach behavior

requirement of extra repeater deployment at vertical transition

conservative commitment philosophy

allowance for partial exploration and refusal

acceptance of early termination as legitimate

Explicit Non-Claims

Phase 0 does not define:

propulsion stability method

attitude control method

exact descent rates

precise imaging method

required mapping fidelity

numeric risk thresholds

Those belong to Phase-1 and beyond.

12. Single-Sentence Doctrine Summary

LCS treats vertical shafts as deliberate, high-risk environments that require slowed approach, heavy pre-scan, strengthened communications, cautious conditional descent, disciplined refusal when risk exceeds value, and acceptance that documenting the boundary may be as valuable as going down it.
