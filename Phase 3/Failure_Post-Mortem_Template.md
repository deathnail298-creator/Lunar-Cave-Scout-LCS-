09 — Phase 3 Failure Post-Mortem Template

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS)
Phase 3

Purpose of This Document

This template exists to extract truth, accountability, and learning from failure.

It prevents:

blame theater

political rewriting

shallow “lessons learned” hand-waving

emotional excuse-making

Failure is only useful if it produces disciplined intelligence.

This template structures that discipline.

Failure Post-Mortem Report

(Complete all sections. Incomplete truth is failure.)

1️⃣ Event Declaration

Event Name:
Date / Time:
Mission / Execution Context:
Location / Environment:
Primary Authority on Console:
People Present:

Failure Type (select all that apply):

☐ Controlled Technical Failure

☐ Boundary Honesty Failure

☐ Communications Collapse

☐ Graceful Degradation Failure

☐ Uncontrolled Failure

☐ Catastrophic Loss

☐ Doctrine Violation Failure

☐ Governance Breakdown Failure

Severity:

☐ Low

☐ Moderate

☐ High

☐ Critical

Containability:

☐ Contained

☐ Controlled Cascade

☐ Uncontrolled

2️⃣ Blunt Truth Summary

Describe the failure in one clear, blunt paragraph.

No marketing language.
No defensive framing.
No justification embellishment.

What happened:

Write clearly. No evasion.

3️⃣ Timeline of Events

Provide a precise, disciplined timeline including:

key actions

key system states

key decisions

comms posture changes

energy margin changes

sensing quality changes

breadcrumb chain realities

doctrine engagement moments

stop/retreat decisions

Timeline:

Time-coded, structured, factual.

4️⃣ Envelope Context

Failure must be interpreted relative to envelopes.

Stability Envelope

Within bounds? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Evidence:

Communications Envelope

Within bounds? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Evidence:

Sensing Envelope

Within bounds? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Evidence:

Energy / Thermal Envelope

Within bounds? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Evidence:

Vertical / High-Risk Envelope (if applicable)

Within bounds? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Evidence:

If envelope truth is unknown → document that failure explicitly.

5️⃣ Governing Doctrine Compliance Assessment

Failure is unacceptable if doctrine was ignored.

Communications Doctrine

Followed? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Evidence:

Risk & Failure Doctrine

Followed? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Evidence:

Field Deployment Doctrine

Followed? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Evidence:

Governance / Stop Authority Doctrine

Followed? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Evidence:

End-of-Life Doctrine (if applicable)

Followed? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Evidence:

If doctrine was ignored,
state it plainly.
No euphemisms.

6️⃣ Decision Integrity Analysis

Failures are rarely purely technical.
They are often decision failures.

Analyze:

Was execution momentum-driven?

Were there ignored objections?

Was there schedule pressure influence?

Did Program Authority pressure Technical or Operations Authority?

Did anyone override doctrine?

Did anyone hesitate to call STOP?

Decision Integrity Findings:

Write truthfully. Names are allowed.
Accountability is real.

7️⃣ Technical Root Cause Analysis

This is not superficial guessing.
Root cause analysis must follow disciplined thinking:

observed failure behavior

contributing technical factors

triggering conditions

why earlier signs were missed

why system failed as it did

whether failure mode was predictable

Primary Root Cause:

Contributing Causes:

Was this preventable?

☐ Yes

☐ Potentially

☐ Unknown

☐ No

Explain.

8️⃣ Communications & Data Integrity Assessment
Data Retention Outcome

☐ Full data preserved

☐ Partial data preserved

☐ Minimal data preserved

☐ Data lost (unacceptable unless justified)

Explain:

Communications Chain Truth

performance analysis

collapse dynamics (if applicable)

breadcrumb behavior truth

Explain:

9️⃣ System Behavior Assessment
Did system exhibit graceful degradation?

☐ Yes

☐ Partially

☐ No (unacceptable)

Explain:

Did shutdown / retreat doctrine function?

☐ Yes

☐ Partially

☐ No

Explain:

🔟 Governance & Authority Performance Review

Did governance work?

Technical Authority role performance:

Honest assessment.


Operations Authority role performance:

Honest assessment.


Program Authority behavior:

Honest assessment.


Did stop authority function when necessary?

☐ Yes

☐ Hesitated dangerously

☐ Failed

1️⃣1️⃣ Residual Impact

Document:

impact on mission credibility

impact on hardware inventory

impact on envelopes

impact on doctrine assumptions

impact on future deployment readiness

1️⃣2️⃣ Lessons Extracted

Lessons must be:

concrete

actionable

structural

discipline-reinforcing

No vague “we’ll be more careful next time.”

Lessons Learned:

1️⃣3️⃣ Required Corrections
Doctrine Corrections

(if any)

Technical Corrections

(if any)

Governance Corrections

(if any)

Training Corrections

(if any)

Communications Strategy Corrections

(if any)

Corrections require:

ownership

deadlines

accountability

List owners and timelines explicitly.

1️⃣4️⃣ Acceptance & Closure

This event is not closed until:

analysis approved by Technical Authority

operational doctrine alignment reviewed

governance confidence restored

leadership formally briefed

Technical Authority:
Signature / Date:

Operations Authority:
Signature / Date:

Program Authority Acknowledgment:
Signature / Date:

Archive record ID:

Non-Claims & Boundaries

This document does NOT:

excuse failure

normalize uncontrolled loss

serve as public messaging

substitute legal reporting

It ensures failure yields disciplined truth and structural improvement.

One-Sentence Program Summary

The Phase-3 Failure Post-Mortem Template ensures failure is confronted honestly, governed rigorously, analyzed structurally, and converted into disciplined improvements — without ego, politics, or spin.
