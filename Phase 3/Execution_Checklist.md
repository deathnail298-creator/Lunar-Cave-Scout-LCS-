07 — Phase 3 Execution Checklist

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS)
Phase 3

1. Purpose of This Checklist

This checklist exists to prevent irresponsible execution.

Execution only proceeds when each gate is consciously satisfied — not assumed, not hand-waved, not implied.

This checklist enforces:

governance discipline

readiness truth

operational control

risk responsibility

communications credibility

ethical accountability

If any checkpoint fails,
execution does not proceed.

No exceptions.
No emotional overrides.
No executive pressure hacks.

2. Checklist Philosophy

This checklist is designed to:

force explicit thinking

surface weak confidence

expose unjustified assumptions

ensure authority accountability

stop momentum-driven mistakes

The rule is simple:

If you cannot confidently check a box, you do not deserve to continue.

Execution is a privilege.
It must be earned.

3. Phase-3 Execution Checklist

Below is the mandatory execution gate structure.

Each section requires:

confirmation

signature ownership

recorded time stamp

A. Governance Authorization Gate

Execution does not begin without all three:

☐ Program Authority approval documented

☐ Technical Authority execution readiness approval signed

☐ Operations Authority go-decision signed

☐ Stop Authority roles explicitly assigned

☐ Mission scope documented and bounded

☐ Mission termination authority agreed and written

If governance is unclear → NO EXECUTION

B. Validation Confirmation Gate

Execution must only occur if Phase-3 validation remains credible.

☐ Phase-3 Validation & Acceptance remains CURRENT

☐ No outstanding unresolved Phase-3 validation failures

☐ No major design or doctrine changes invalidate acceptance

☐ Risk posture explicitly reviewed and accepted

☐ Leadership understands residual risk

If validation is out of date → NO EXECUTION

C. Operational Readiness Gate

Before moving toward deployment:

☐ Operational Execution Plan reviewed

☐ Operators trained and certified

☐ mission objectives realistic & bounded

☐ doctrine compliance acknowledged by operators

☐ irreversible decision doctrine reviewed

☐ retreat doctrine rehearsed

☐ termination doctrine rehearsed

If operations maturity is questionable → NO EXECUTION

D. System Readiness Gate

System readiness is not feelings-based.
It is evidence-based.

☐ Full-system diagnostic passed

☐ propulsion confidence established

☐ sensing systems stable & calibrated

☐ compute & autonomy performing as expected

☐ logging systems verified

☐ graceful shutdown confirmed functional

If system health is uncertain → NO EXECUTION

E. Communications Gate

Communications is mission backbone.

☐ baseline link stability confirmed

☐ breadcrumb inventory staged & functional

☐ chain deployment strategy reviewed

☐ fallback comms strategy defined

☐ acceptable comms modes acknowledged

☐ unacceptable comms modes agreed and enforced

If communications truth is uncertain → NO EXECUTION

F. Energy & Thermal Credibility Gate

Execution requires survivability margin, not fantasy endurance.

☐ power reserve meets operational doctrine

☐ energy budget reviewed

☐ reserve margin explicitly acknowledged

☐ thermal stability expectations confirmed

☐ energy failure behavior reviewed

If margin is thin → NO EXECUTION

G. Ethical & Environmental Gate

Execution must remain responsible.

☐ planetary protection compliance reviewed

☐ environmental stewardship acknowledged

☐ ethical deployment posture reviewed

☐ no reckless exploitation motives

☐ no showmanship intent

If execution is driven by ego → NO EXECUTION

H. High-Risk Environment Gate (If Applicable)

If mission expects:

vertical environments

constrictions

heavy occlusion

extreme communications segmentation

Then:

☐ vertical doctrine reviewed

☐ risk elevation acknowledged

☐ explicit approval recorded

☐ operators accept No-Go outcomes

☐ breadcrumb reinforcement plan in place

If high-risk execution is not explicitly justified → NO EXECUTION

I. Pre-Execution Final Stop Check

Immediately before execution:

☐ Technical Authority final “Ready” statement

☐ Operations Authority final “Ready” statement

☐ Any team member allowed to object

☐ Stop authority reconfirmed

☐ No open concerns ignored

If any authority hesitates → STOP

Silence is not consent.
Confidence must be explicit.

J. Post-Execution Obligation Gate (Mandatory Commitment)

Execution is not complete until:

☐ mission performance log archived

☐ communications chain behavior analyzed

☐ failure or deviation review committed

☐ leadership transparency commitment reaffirmed

☐ learning extraction required

There is no “we just move on.”

4. Failure to Complete Checklist

Failure to satisfy checklist requirements means:

execution halts

justification documented

review triggered

leadership notified

responsibility preserved

This is not bureaucracy.
This is professionalism.

5. Accountability Signatures

Execution Checklist Approved By:

Technical Authority: _________________________

Operations Authority: _______________________

Program Authority Acknowledgment: _____________

Date / Time: _________________________________

Record retained permanently.

6. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

This checklist requires:

real readiness

governance discipline

explicit ownership

refusal to gamble

ethical posture

learning commitment

Not Claimed

This checklist does NOT:

authorize execution alone

declare lunar readiness

remove licensing requirements

imply legal certification

It ensures no execution happens irresponsibly.

7. One-Sentence Summary

The Phase-3 Execution Checklist enforces disciplined readiness, authority clarity, communications credibility, risk honesty, ethical posture, and stop-power maturity — ensuring execution only happens when it deserves to.
