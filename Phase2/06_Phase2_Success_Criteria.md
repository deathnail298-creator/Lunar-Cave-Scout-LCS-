06 — Phase-2 Success Criteria

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 2

1. Purpose of This Document

Phase 2 exists to answer a harder question than Phase 1:

Can the Lunar Cave Scout mature into a disciplined, reliable, integrated system with honest performance boundaries and a credible readiness trajectory — or does responsible honesty require stopping?

This document defines what “success” actually means in Phase 2 terms:

what must be proven,

what evidence must exist,

what confidence must be earned,

and when we declare progress legitimate rather than wishful.

Phase 2 success is not about hype.
It is about maturity.

2. Philosophy of Phase-2 Success

Phase 2 success is not defined by:

pretty demos

marketing theatrics

optimistic narrative

“it worked once in a video” confidence

Phase 2 success is defined by:

coherence

reliability

discipline

evidence

honesty

Phase 2 succeeds when:

LCS demonstrates integrated system behavior, trustworthy reliability under stress, evidence-based performance envelopes, matured risk posture, and credible forward trajectory — or Phase 2 has the courage to declare that advancing would be irresponsible.

3. Core Phase-2 Success Criteria

Phase 2 is considered successful when the following core criteria are met.

Criterion 1 — Integration Behavior Is Real and Coherent

Phase 2 must prove:

subsystems reinforce each other

authority hierarchy works in real operation

communications meaningfully constrains navigation

breadcrumb deployment supports communications backbone

sensing uncertainty visibly shapes decision behavior

failure authority genuinely overrides reckless ambition

Reviewers should say:

“This behaves like a system, not a bag of parts.”

If subsystems still behave independently, Phase 2 did not succeed.

Criterion 2 — Performance Envelopes Are Real and Defensible

Phase 2 must deliver:

documented stability envelope

documented perception envelope

documented communications envelope

documented operational complexity envelope

documented vertical envelope (or formal prohibition)

documented degradation envelope

These envelopes must be:

grounded in evidence

supported by structured and analog testing

coherent with reliability doctrine

honest about uncomfortable truths

If envelopes are vague, aspirational, or hand-wavy, Phase 2 fails.

Criterion 3 — Reliability & Graceful Degradation Are Engineered, Not Claimed

Phase 2 must prove:

the system becomes safer under uncertainty

behavior slows and stabilizes as trouble rises

stabilization preference clearly exists

retreat capability is credible

shutdown is controlled and responsible

reliability state transitions are observable and explainable

If reliability is luck rather than engineering,
Phase 2 fails.

Criterion 4 — Risk Maturity Is Substantially Increased

Phase 2 must show:

risk is explicitly characterized (severity, likelihood, trajectory)

mitigation strategies are credible instead of rhetorical

residual risk is honestly owned

risk posture aligns with envelope boundaries

risk informs doctrine, not the other way around

Reviewers must feel:

“They aren’t hiding from risk; they understand it and take it seriously.”

If risk remains vague or optimistic, Phase 2 fails.

Criterion 5 — Vertical Doctrine Is Finalized Responsibly

Phase 2 must move from discussion to decision.

Two acceptable success states:

Path A — Vertical Operations Proven Boundedly Viable

clear vertical envelope

strict behavior discipline

communications anchoring works

reliability survives

doctrine supports reality

Path B — Vertical Operations Declared Out-of-Scope

prohibition enforced structurally

boundaries clearly documented

operational justification remains strong without them

There is no “maybe someday” position in Phase 2.

Criterion 6 — Phase-2 Evidence Is Trustworthy

Phase 2 success requires:

structured test evidence

analog environment support

repeatability where reasonable

representativeness of environments

alignment between simulation, structured testing, and analog truth

If results require belief instead of proof, Phase 2 fails.

4. Coherence Requirement

Phase 2 success is not a collection of isolated wins.

Success requires coherence:

integration supports envelopes

envelopes align with reliability

reliability aligns with risk truth

risk truth reinforces doctrine

evidence supports all of the above

If any of these contradict each other,
Phase 2 does not get to claim success.

5. Confidence Standard

Phase 2 success requires responsible confidence, meaning:

confidence grounded in evidence

confidence transparent about limits

confidence mature enough to own uncertainty

confidence strong enough to justify Phase 3 framing

Confidence that relies on hope,
or selective storytelling,
does not qualify.

6. Acceptable Phase-2 Success Paths

There are three valid Phase-2 success outcomes:

Success Path A — Strong Readiness Trajectory

System is coherent, reliable, evidence-backed, disciplined, and credible.
Advancing to Phase 3 is justified.

Success Path B — Doctrine-Adjusted Readiness

System is viable,
but doctrine, expectations, or operational framing must evolve.

This counts as success,
because maturity means listening to truth.

Success Path C — Responsible Program Termination

Phase 2 proves:

structural fragility,

unacceptable risk,

non-credible reliance on hope,

or inability to produce survivable behavior.

Ending is success.
It protects missions.
It respects reality.

The only unacceptable outcome is denial.

7. Documentation Requirement

Phase-2 success requires:

documented conclusions

explicit envelope statements

structured reliability description

matured risk register

final vertical doctrine declaration

clear recommendation: advance, adjust, or terminate

If success cannot be defended in writing, it is not success.

8. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

Phase 2 success demands:

real integration

real envelopes

real reliability

real risk maturity

final vertical doctrine truth

evidence-backed confidence

Not Claimed

This document does not:

declare lunar readiness

claim mission certification

finalize hardware

declare Phase 3 automatic

Those belong to Phase 3 evaluations.

9. One-Sentence Definition of Phase-2 Success

Phase 2 is successful when the Lunar Cave Scout demonstrates disciplined system integration, evidence-grounded performance envelopes, engineered reliability and graceful degradation, mature risk ownership, responsible vertical doctrine resolution, and a credible readiness trajectory — or when Phase 2 has the maturity to stop because reality demands it.
