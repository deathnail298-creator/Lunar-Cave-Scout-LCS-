05 — Risk Register Expansion & Mitigation Paths

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 2

1. Purpose of This Document

Phase 1 acknowledged risk.

Phase 2 must do something harder:

Confront risk explicitly, characterize it honestly, and describe credible mitigation paths — or admit when mitigation does not exist.

This document:

expands the Phase-1 risk register,

increases rigor and structure,

drives mitigation planning,

and ensures risk maturity matches engineering maturity.

Phase 2 is not “believe it will work.”
Phase 2 is prove we understand where it doesn’t — and what we’re doing about it.

2. Philosophy of Risk in Phase 2

Phase 2 rejects:

optimistic dismissal of risk

vague “we’ll figure it out later”

rhetorical confidence masquerading as engineering

Phase 2 risk doctrine:

1️⃣ Risks must be described precisely.
2️⃣ Risks must be tied to engineering reality, not vibes.
3️⃣ Mitigations must be credible — or explicitly acknowledged as uncertain.
4️⃣ Residual risk must be owned, not hidden.

If a risk cannot be mitigated responsibly,
Phase 2 must say so.

3. Risk Classification Framework

Phase 2 introduces a structured classification model:

Severity

Low – nuisance, operational discomfort

Moderate – meaningful impact, but survivable

High – mission-threatening

Critical – system-invalidating

Likelihood

Low – unlikely but possible

Moderate – realistic probability

High – expected in real environments

Trajectory

Stable → manageable

Increasing → becomes worse with operation

Cascading → triggers secondary failures

Disposition

Engineering Mitigation Available

Operational Mitigation Only

Doctrine Risk (change rules, not hardware)

Structural / Concept Threat

Phase 2 refuses to pretend all risks are engineering solvable.

4. Expanded Phase-2 Risk Register

Below is the structured Phase-2 risk set.
These expand and deepen Phase-1.

Risk 1 — Free-Flight Stability Fragility

If LCS cannot maintain disciplined hover, low-speed precision, and recovery confidence under realistic disturbance, the system collapses.

Severity: High
Likelihood: Moderate
Trajectory: Cascading
Disposition: Engineering Mitigation Required

Mitigation Paths

stability tuning and control refinement

deliberate conservative motion doctrine reinforcement

stabilization-priority reliability behaviors (Phase-2 alignment)

envelope definition limiting reckless operating domains

Residual Risk:

remains significant in narrow, turbulent, complex cave aerodynamics

Risk 2 — Sensing & Perception Truth Failure

If sensing cannot provide meaningful, coherent truth in darkness, occlusion, geometry irregularity, or low feature environments → navigation is fantasy.

Severity: Critical
Likelihood: Moderate
Trajectory: Cascading
Disposition: Potential Concept Threat if unmitigable

Mitigation Paths

diversified sensing (complementary modalities)

improved uncertainty modeling rather than false confidence

conservative navigation enforcement when sensing weakens

disciplined “slow down when unsure” doctrine

Residual Risk:

some environments may always be beyond responsible capability

envelope boundaries may become restrictive — which is acceptable

Risk 3 — Communications Chain Unrealism

If communications chaining requires impractical density, collapses regularly, or fails in realistic analog geometries → mission viability erodes.

Severity: High
Likelihood: Moderate–High
Trajectory: Cascading
Disposition: Doctrine + Engineering Mitigation

Mitigation Paths

realistic spacing expectation development

treat “partial comms” as valuable rather than binary thinking

breadcrumb deployment discipline

fallback autonomy posture strengthened

acceptance that some cave geometries are out-of-envelope

Residual Risk:

high in highly segmented, highly occluded caverns

must be honestly owned

Risk 4 — Breadcrumb Deployment Risk

If deploying breadcrumbs destabilizes the vehicle, delays mission rhythm, or proves logistically impractical — communications mitigation decays.

Severity: Moderate–High
Likelihood: Moderate
Trajectory: Increasing
Disposition: Engineering + Operational

Mitigation Paths

stability anchoring during deployment

simple, robust mechanical design

doctrine emphasizing “placement resilience, not perfection”

minimize mission disruption during deployment

Residual Risk:

will always introduce operational overhead; maturity must accept and plan for it

Risk 5 — Failure Without Grace

If failure is chaotic, uncontrolled, or destroys mission value → operational trust is impossible.

Severity: Critical
Likelihood: Unknown (Phase-2 discovering truth)
Trajectory: Cascading
Disposition: Engineering + Doctrine

Mitigation Paths

structured degradation tiers (Phase-2 reliability work)

stabilization-first responses

controlled shutdown posture

attempt to preserve useful data

avoid “heroic attempts” when unsafe

Residual Risk:

depends on quality of engineering execution — not doctrine alone

Risk 6 — Vertical Environment Risk

Vertical environments may be:

manageable

extremely risky

fundamentally incompatible

Phase-2 must stop guessing.

Severity: High → Critical if mishandled
Likelihood: Environment-dependent
Trajectory: Cascading
Disposition: Doctrine Decision + Engineering Support

Mitigation Paths

heavily conservative vertical doctrine

strong comms anchoring requirements

strict refusal capability

possibly declaring many vertical environments out-of-scope permanently

Residual Risk:

may result in prohibited environments — which is maturity, not failure

Risk 7 — Environmental Representativeness Risk

If simulation lies and analogs contradict structured testing,
confidence cannot exist.

Severity: High (truth anchor risk)
Likelihood: Moderate
Trajectory: Cascading
Disposition: Program Discipline Issue

Mitigation Paths

embrace analog complexity

triangulate truth between simulation + structured + analog

refuse overconfidence from single-source validation

Residual Risk:

some uncertainty always exists; honesty must remain

Risk 8 — Operational Complexity & Burden

If operational overhead becomes:

too high

too slow

too maintenance-intense

too cognitively demanding

then LCS becomes a liability rather than an asset.

Severity: Moderate–High
Likelihood: Moderate
Trajectory: Increasing with mission timeline
Disposition: Doctrine + Operational Refinement

Mitigation Paths

predictable operating rhythm reinforcement

automation refinement

coherent mission pacing

explicit performance envelopes defining sustainable use

Residual Risk:

real; must be acknowledged

5. Mitigation Philosophy

Mitigation is not:

hand-waving

hope

“Phase-3 problem”

“we’ll get better later”

Mitigation must be:

credible

disciplined

realistically achievable

tied to engineering or doctrine truthfully

If mitigation isn’t real,
we don’t list it.

6. Residual Risk Ownership

After mitigation,
some risks will remain.

Phase-2 requires:

residual risk to be explicitly documented

residual risk to be consciously accepted

residual risk NEVER to be hidden

A mature program says:

“We know the risk, we understand it, we own it.”

Immature programs pretend risk doesn’t exist.

We are not doing that.

7. Interaction with Other Phase-2 Pillars

Expanded risk maturity strengthens:

Performance Envelopes

risk defines envelope edges

Reliability Model

degradation logic connects directly to risks

Integration Discipline

subsystems mitigate each other’s vulnerabilities

Success Criteria

success means risk clarity, not risk denial

Risk informs everything.
Risk honesty creates credibility.

8. Failure Interpretation

If Phase-2 reveals risks that are:

structural

fundamental

unmitigable

unacceptable

then the correct Phase-2 outcome is:

responsible termination

That is not failure.
That is maturity.

9. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

risks must be explicit

mitigation must be real

residual risk must be owned

risk maturity is core to Phase-2 credibility

honesty beats optimism every time

Not Claimed

This document does NOT:

guarantee mitigation success

assert risk elimination

promise mission viability

declare Phase-3 readiness

Those belong to later evaluation.

10. One-Sentence Summary

Phase-2 expands and hardens the Lunar Cave Scout risk register into a disciplined, structured, mitigation-anchored truth document — ensuring we confront reality honestly, engineer responsibly, and either advance with confidence or stop with integrity.
