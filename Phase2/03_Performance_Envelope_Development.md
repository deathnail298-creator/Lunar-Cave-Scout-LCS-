03 — Performance Envelope Development

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 2

1. Purpose of This Document

Phase 1 proved that the Lunar Cave Scout concept is real and credible.

Phase 2 must now prove something harder:

Where is LCS genuinely capable, where is it marginal, and where is it irresponsible to use?

This document defines the philosophy, structure, and expectations of Performance Envelope Development:

how envelopes are defined,

how limits are determined,

how uncertainty is handled,

and how confidence is earned honestly rather than asserted.

This prevents the “it works everywhere if you believe hard enough” fantasy that kills credibility.

2. What a Performance Envelope Is (and Is Not)

A performance envelope is:

the documented operational reality of the system

the boundary of responsible behavior

a tool for engineering discipline

an anchor for future readiness arguments

A performance envelope is NOT:

a marketing claim

a promise to customers

a certification document

a bravado statement

The envelope is reality,
and Phase 2 is about discovering it honestly, not negotiating it emotionally.

3. Core Envelope Domains

Phase 2 performance envelopes must be developed across six primary domains.

Envelope A — Stability Envelope

Defines:

where the system is predictably stable

where stability becomes fragile

where operation becomes reckless

Includes:

maximum stable hover accuracy ranges

acceptable drift thresholds

disturbance tolerance limits

response reliability under low-speed maneuvering

Evidence should support statements like:

“LCS is predictably stable in these conditions, cautiously stable here, and not stable beyond this.”

Envelope B — Sensing & Perception Envelope

Defines:

where environmental perception is reliable

where perception becomes strained but manageable

where perception becomes dangerously unreliable

Includes:

geometry feature richness dependence

darkness / illumination dependency outcomes

occlusion tolerance

mapping coherence longevity

This answers:

“In what kinds of environments does LCS still meaningfully understand its surroundings?”

Envelope C — Communications Viability Envelope

Defines:

where communications chaining is realistic

where breadcrumb strategies remain sufficient

where geometry overwhelms communications credibility

Includes:

typical repeater spacing feasibility

realistic connectivity persistence probability

partial connectivity usefulness truth

environments where comms collapse is the norm

This defines where communications doctrine is real versus wishful.

Envelope D — Operational Complexity Envelope

Defines:

what mission dynamics LCS can realistically handle

what rhythm it can operate within

and where operational burden becomes too high

Includes:

how often it must pause to think

how often it must correct positioning

how tolerable it is of accumulated uncertainties

how operational tempo degrades under stress

This determines:

“Where is LCS a responsible mission element versus an operational liability?”

Envelope E — Vertical & Discontinuity Envelope

This envelope is doctrine critical.

It defines whether:

vertical environments are inside scope,

partially in scope,

restricted scope,

or outright prohibited.

Includes:

recognition reliability

scan → decide → commit credibility

comms survivability in downward motion

failure risk trajectories

If Phase 1 indicated vertical viability,
Phase 2 proves how bounded it is.

If Phase 1 rejected verticals,
Phase 2 ensures the envelope enforces that rejection truthfully.

Envelope F — Failure & Degradation Envelope

Defines:

where graceful degradation remains meaningful

where the system can remain safe but not useful

where termination is likely

where catastrophic collapse is unavoidable

Includes:

sensing-loss boundaries

comms-loss resilience limits

instability tolerance limits

“how much trouble before we stop pretending?” clarity

This ensures honesty about survivability under stress.

4. Envelope Structure — How We Define Them

Each envelope must articulate:

1️⃣ Primary Operable Region

where performance is strong

confidence is high

system behavior is well understood

2️⃣ Marginal / Caution Region

performance possible

risk tolerable

but confidence demands caution and discipline

3️⃣ Do Not Operate Region

where responsible engineering says “no”

where the system should not be deployed

where doctrine explicitly prohibits operation

There must not be ambiguous hand-wavy gray zones.

If the reality is uncertain, we document uncertainty explicitly — not hide it.

5. Evidence & Methodology Standard

Performance envelope development must be:

data-informed

test-supported

repeatability-seeking

coherent with integration doctrine

grounded in analog exposure

cross-validated where reasonable

Acceptable evidence sources:

Phase-1 test data

Phase-2 structured testing

analog environment results

simulation when aligned with real behavior

engineering reasoning supported by observed truth

Unacceptable evidence sources:

optimism

“gut feeling” confidence

single cherry-picked demo success

simulated fantasy disconnected from reality

Phase-2 refuses to pretend confidence equals competence.

6. Interaction with Other Phase-2 Pillars

Performance envelopes link directly to:

Integration Architecture

Envelopes shape allowable system behavior

Reliability & Graceful Degradation

Envelopes expose where degradation matters

Risk Register Expansion

Envelope edges are risk accelerators

System Maturity Objectives

Maturity requires disciplined envelope reality

Envelope discipline is the spine that keeps Phase-2 honest.

7. The “No Heroics” Rule

Phase-2 performance envelope doctrine explicitly rejects:

bravery engineering

“stretch goal operating domains”

extreme environment hero stories

If an environment is beyond envelope,
we don’t cheer for courage.
We enforce discipline.

A mature system knows where it belongs.
A reckless one pretends everything is possible.

We are building the former.

8. Expected Phase-2 Envelope Deliverables

By the end of Phase 2, performance envelope development must yield:

narrative envelope definitions

structured explanation of each envelope region

supporting evidence discussion

known uncertainties explicitly documented

forward recommendations

clear linkage to risk and doctrine policy

Reviewers should walk away saying:

“I know where LCS belongs, where it barely belongs, and where it absolutely should not go — and I trust that conclusion.”

9. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

envelopes must be real, not aspirational

envelopes must guide responsible use

envelopes must expose uncomfortable truths

envelopes must support disciplined maturity

envelopes must be evidence-informed

Not Claimed

This document does not:

assert lunar certification

promise specific performance numbers

define contractual guarantees

finalize operational doctrine commitments

Those are Phase-3 territory.

10. One-Sentence Summary

Phase-2 Performance Envelope Development defines where the Lunar Cave Scout is truly capable, marginally capable, or irresponsible to use — grounded in evidence, discipline, risk honesty, and engineering maturity, not optimism.
