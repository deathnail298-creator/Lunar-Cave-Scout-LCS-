08 — License & Execution Guardrails

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 1

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines:

how Phase-1 material may be used,

what is free,

what requires permission or licensing,

how execution is bounded,

and how program integrity is protected.

The intent is simple:

Think freely. Experiment freely. Learn freely.
Execution, commercialization, operational deployment, or institutionalization requires a license.

This ensures maximum proliferation of ideas while preventing silent commercial extraction.

2. Philosophy

Phase-1 exists to:

enable research,

enable disciplined engineering exploration,

empower academic and nonprofit experimentation,

allow internal studies and prototyping,

and accelerate technical maturity.

Phase-1 does not exist to:

provide free commercial IP,

enable silent productization,

allow quiet institutional capture,

or transfer execution rights without compensation.

Ideas should spread.
Work should be rewarded.
That’s the balance.

3. What You Are Free To Do (No Payment, No Permission Required)

You are explicitly allowed to:

read

analyze

study

critique

discuss

cite

teach

use in academic contexts

use in nonprofit research

build exploratory internal prototypes

conduct internal technical evaluations

use this as a thinking tool

evaluate feasibility

perform learning-only experiments

You do not owe money for thinking, learning, exploring, or early internal proof-of-concept efforts that are not deployed, funded, sold, or institutionalized.

This work is meant to help people think better.

4. What Requires a License (Commercial / Institutional Use)

A paid license is required when any of the following become true:

1️⃣ The system is commercialized, monetized, incorporated into a product, or used in revenue-generating activity.
2️⃣ The system is operationally deployed in any capacity beyond internal research.
3️⃣ The system is institutionalized as an ongoing capability within a company, agency, or organization.
4️⃣ The work becomes part of a funded program, grant-backed project, contracted effort, or deliverable.
5️⃣ A derivative implementation is developed with intent to deploy rather than merely study.

Simply put:

If you’re using this for profit, production, institutional capability, field deployment, or funded execution — you need a license.

No “interpretive wiggle room.”
No “we were just experimenting — at scale — for years.”
No silent extraction.

5. Execution Guardrails

Execution is bounded by doctrine.

Even licensed execution must respect:

Phase separation

Scope discipline

Safety and risk integrity

Honest claims

Technical maturity boundaries

Specifically:

Phase-1 does not authorize lunar deployment

Phase-1 does not authorize operational use

Phase-1 does not validate mission-readiness

Phase-1 explicitly acknowledges unknowns

Phase-1 exists to learn, not to posture competence

Any attempt to treat Phase-1 material as certified operational architecture is irresponsible and explicitly disclaimed.

6. Integrity Protection

This project protects:

doctrinal integrity

safety integrity

technical credibility

program maturity discipline

The following behaviors are explicitly discouraged and not supported:

misrepresenting Phase-1 status as “ready for space”

presenting this work as proven lunar-certifiable hardware

erasing explicit risks and constraints

selectively quoting doctrine to avoid responsibility

detaching testing truth from later claims

If you build from this work,
you inherit responsibility to represent it honestly.

7. Attribution Requirements

If you use this work:

credit must be provided

source must be acknowledged

derivative work must state it is derivative

fidelity to doctrine must be represented honestly

Attribution is not optional.

8. Relationship To Phase-0 License Logic

Phase-0 and Phase-1 share the same backbone philosophy:

free to think

free to explore

free to prototype

not free to commercialize or operationalize

Phase-1 simply moves from conceptual clarity to technical credibility —
but the licensing spine remains the same.

9. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

thinking/testing = free

commercialization/operation = license

doctrine integrity must be preserved

Phase-1 evidence does not equal certification

responsible attribution required

Not Claimed

This document does not:

define royalty structure

assign exclusivity terms

define legal contract language

establish formal enforcement policy

Those belong to formal licensing agreements.

10. Single-Sentence Summary

You are free to think, study, test, and learn from Phase-1 however you like — but if you turn the Lunar Cave Scout into a product, capability, funded program, or operational system, you need a license, and you are expected to preserve the project’s honesty, safety, and doctrinal discipline.
