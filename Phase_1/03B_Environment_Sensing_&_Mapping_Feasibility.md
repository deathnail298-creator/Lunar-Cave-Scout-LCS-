03B — Environment Sensing & Mapping Feasibility

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 1

1. Purpose of This Test Domain

This document defines how Phase-1 determines whether LCS can meaningfully perceive and understand its environment — not perfectly, not heroically, but usefully and reliably enough to support disciplined behavior.

Phase-0 doctrine requires that LCS:

navigates carefully,

avoids surfaces,

behaves conservatively,

and makes decisions based on truth, not guessing.

Phase-1 must therefore prove that:

LCS can generate actionable internal awareness of the cave environment sufficient to support cautious, disciplined operations.

If it cannot perceive enough, it cannot behave safely.
If mapping cannot be trusted, doctrine collapses.

2. What This Test Must Prove

Environment Sensing & Mapping testing must answer six blunt questions:

Q1 — Can LCS Perceive Geometry Reliably Enough to Avoid Collision?

We must demonstrate that sensing can:

detect walls, ceilings, and floor in meaningful time

represent proximity well enough for conservative flight

avoid unexpected geometry collisions

“Close enough to not die” is the requirement.
Not cinematic beauty. Not perfect science maps.

Q2 — Can LCS Build a Useful Operational Representation of Space?

This is not about producing beautiful research-grade 3D reconstructions.

We must prove that:

the mapping product supports navigation

the representation is stable enough to be trusted

uncertainty is handled honestly rather than hidden

the map helps, not misleads

If the map is pretty but operationally useless, the system failed.

Q3 — Can the System Handle Darkness and Visual Poverty?

Lava tubes are:

dark,

visually sparse,

and often devoid of rich optical features.

Phase-1 must prove:

sensing does not depend on light that won’t exist,

reliance on texture-rich environments is avoided,

systems operate as if dark, dusty voids are normal.

If sensing only works in bright lab spaces full of contrast, it is worthless.

Q4 — Can Sensing Handle Irregular, Ugly Geometry?

Testing must prove the system does not crumble when reality becomes ugly:

odd wall contours

overhangs

irregular voids

geometric discontinuities

branching voids

If sensing works only in smooth tunnels, that is self-deception.

Q5 — Does Mapping Stay Coherent Over Time?

Phase-1 must prove:

maps do not drift into unreality immediately

accumulated sensing doesn’t degrade into chaos

system can maintain a workable internal model long enough to matter

If the map becomes fantasy after 30 seconds, it cannot be trusted.

Q6 — Can the System Support Conservative Behavioral Decisions?

Ultimately, sensing and mapping must enable:

slowing when uncertain,

stopping when needed,

refusing risk when geometry is unclear,

reinforcing cautious navigation and termination doctrine.

If sensing forces aggression or blindness, it violates identity.

3. Testing Strategy

Environment Sensing & Mapping feasibility testing follows graded escalation, consistent with the Phase-1 Architecture.

Stage 1 — Controlled Laboratory Sensing Validation

Purpose:

validate fundamentals

Includes:

structured wall detection

distance estimation accuracy

feature-sparse environment observation

controlled mapping trials in known geometry

This proves the sensors and algorithms aren’t fundamentally broken.

Stage 2 — Structured Geometry Testing

Purpose:

prove sensing works when the world becomes interesting

Includes:

corridors with bends

chambers with unexpected expansions

geometry discontinuities

darkness-dominant testing

Focus:

stability of mapping

performance under degraded visibility

ability to maintain useful geometry awareness

Stage 3 — Analog Environment Exposure

Purpose:

prove sensing in real, imperfect voids

Includes:

cave analogs

tunnel systems

structured mine environments where appropriate

Focus:

realistic geometry irregularity

unpredictable reflective behavior

true occlusion scenarios

natural environmental artifacts

If sensing collapses here, doctrine must accept it.

4. Evaluation Standards

Environment Sensing & Mapping is considered credible if:

geometry detection enables safe avoidance

mapping supports meaningful decisions

sensing does not depend on unrealistic visual richness

internal representation remains coherent long enough to matter

sensing supports caution rather than forcing recklessness

Success does not require:

cosmetic perfection

millimeter precision

research-grade reconstruction

Success requires operational usefulness.

5. Failure Interpretation

If Phase-1 testing reveals weakness, Phase-1 must determine whether the issue is:

Engineering-Fixable

Examples:

tuning problems

insufficient filtering

sensor selection immaturity

algorithmic immaturity

These are fine.
They inform iteration.

Doctrinally Concerning

Examples:

requires rich lighting to function

requires feature-dense environments

requires smooth geometry environments

cannot tolerate ambiguity

These challenge the philosophical spine of the system.
Phase-1 must treat them seriously.

Concept-Threatening

Examples:

mapping cannot remain coherent enough to trust

sensing cannot avoid collision reliably

geometry uncertainty is unmanageable

darkness conditions fundamentally break perception

If proven true, Phase-1 integrity demands acknowledging that LCS may not be viable.

6. Data Requirements

Testing must produce:

geometry perception logs

mapping stability data

environment truth vs perceived truth comparisons

test repeatability where possible

analog deviation explanation where not

Phase-1 credibility depends on evidence, not optimism.

7. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

environment perception feasibility is non-negotiable

mapping usefulness matters more than prettiness

sensing must handle darkness and irregular geometry

doctrine must be informed by reality, not hope

Not Claimed

This document does not define:

specific sensor suite

mapping algorithm commitment

long-term lunar performance

autonomy sophistication guarantees

Those belong to later development phases.

8. Single-Sentence Summary

Phase-1 must prove that LCS can meaningfully perceive and map enough of its environment to behave cautiously and safely in dark, irregular voids — producing operationally useful truth rather than fragile, optimistic illusion.
