07 — Phase-1 Success Criteria

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 1

1. Purpose of This Document

Phase-1 exists to answer a single honest question:

Does the Lunar Cave Scout concept deserve to move forward into deeper engineering investment?

This document defines what “success” actually means in Phase-1 terms:

what must be proven,

what evidence must exist,

what confidence must be earned,

and what outcomes justify advancing.

If these criteria are not met, Phase-1 is not successful, regardless of enthusiasm.

2. Philosophy of Phase-1 Success

Phase-1 success is not about:

perfect performance

flawless execution

cinematic demonstrations

making it look impressive

Phase-1 success is about:

credibility

discipline

realism

and proven feasibility

Phase-1 success means:

The core behaviors that define LCS are demonstrated to be technically credible, operationally realistic, and supported by evidence rather than optimism.

Anything less is not success.

3. Primary Phase-1 Success Criteria

Phase-1 is considered successful when the following criteria are satisfied.

Criterion 1 — Free-Flight Behavior Is Proven Credible

Phase-1 must demonstrate:

stable slow-speed control

disciplined, cautious navigation

reliable off-surface behavior

recoverability from minor disturbances

predictable stopping and stabilization

Reviewers should be able to say:

“Yes — this thing can actually fly the way its doctrine says it should.”

Criterion 2 — Environment Sensing & Mapping Are Operationally Useful

Phase-1 must prove:

geometry perception is reliable enough to avoid collision

mapping remains coherent long enough to matter

sensing works in darkness and irregular, feature-poor environments

sensing supports conservative behavior and credible decision-making

Not perfect maps.
Not cinematic visuals.
Operational usefulness.

Criterion 3 — The Breadcrumb Communications Chain Works in Reality

Phase-1 must demonstrate:

repeaters actually extend connectivity in real geometry

partial and intermittent connectivity remain valuable

degraded comms degrade behavior gracefully rather than catastrophically

connectivity shapes behavior meaningfully

analog environment testing supports credibility

Reviewers should conclude:

“This isn’t a PowerPoint idea — this is a real, usable comms backbone.”

Criterion 4 — Breadcrumb Deployment Is Realistically Achievable

Phase-1 must demonstrate:

deployment can occur without destabilizing flight

placement does not require unrealistic precision

deployment integrates into mission rhythm

deployment still works under geometry pressure

deployment demonstrably improves communications reliability

If “we can talk but can’t deploy nodes,” Phase-1 fails here.

Criterion 5 — Failure & Termination Behavior Is Engineered and Trustworthy

Phase-1 must prove:

failure can be detected

the system slows and stabilizes under stress

useful data survives where reasonably possible

termination is deliberate and controlled

failure does not cascade into broader mission harm

Reviewers should feel:

“If this thing dies, it dies responsibly.”

Criterion 6 — Vertical Doctrine Is Either Proven Credible or Honestly Rejected

Phase-1 success requires one of two outcomes — both valid:

Acceptable Success Path A

vertical environments are proven manageable

scanning helps

comms anchoring helps

descent or near-edge operations remain disciplined and credible

Acceptable Success Path B

vertical environments are proven irresponsible or unrealistic

doctrine formally rejects vertical exploration

boundaries are clearly locked and owned

Success is not “we pretended it might work someday.”
Success is discipline and honesty, whichever way the truth falls.

Criterion 7 — Testing Environments Are Proven Trustworthy

Phase-1 success requires:

simulation results make sense and inform development

structured testing validates disciplined technical truth

analog environments do not contradict everything learned

outcomes across environments form a coherent story

If we cannot trust our test sources, Phase-1 cannot claim success.

4. Coherence Requirement

Phase-1 success is not a checklist of disconnected green lights.

Success requires coherence:

flight stability supports mapping

mapping supports comms-informed decisions

comms supports safe mission rhythm

deployment reinforces communications doctrine

failure behavior is consistent with everything above

vertical doctrine aligns honestly with capability

simulation + structured + analog testing tell one consistent truth

If these systems do not support each other, Phase-1 did not succeed.

5. Confidence Standard

Phase-1 does not require certainty.
Phase-1 requires responsible confidence.

Confidence is sufficient when:

results are repeatable where appropriate

variability is understood rather than ignored

limits and weaknesses are documented honestly

risk posture is preserved truthfully

reviewers walk away believing the system has discipline, credibility, and technical seriousness

If confidence requires hand-waving, Phase-1 failed.

6. Acceptable Success Outcomes

Phase-1 success can take three legitimate forms:

Success Outcome A — Full Doctrine Confidence

Most core doctrines survive intact with credible proof.

This leads to:

strong Phase-2 justification

expanded engineering investment

increased technical ambition

Success Outcome B — Doctrine-Adjusted Success

Core capability is validated,
but Phase-0 doctrine requires modification.

Examples:

vertical exploration becomes out-of-scope

comms density expectations revise

some environments are excluded

This is still success.
It’s disciplined evolution.

Success Outcome C — Responsible Program Termination

Phase-1 proves:

LCS does not meaningfully work,

or cannot realistically be made to work,

or cannot be trusted responsibly.

This outcome is also success because:

it prevents wasted investment,

prevents mission risk,

and demonstrates program maturity.

Honesty is success.

7. Documentation Requirement

Phase-1 success requires:

documented test evidence

disciplined analysis

clarity on what worked, what didn’t, and why

explicit declaration of doctrine state post-Phase-1

clear justification for advancing or stopping

If success cannot be defended in writing, it is not success.

8. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

Phase-1 success requires:

demonstrated feasibility

disciplined behavior

coherent truth across pillars

evidence-based confidence

honesty in uncomfortable areas

Not Claimed

This document does not:

guarantee lunar mission success

declare full readiness

finalize hardware

claim operational deployment validation

Those belong to later phases.

9. One-Sentence Definition of Phase-1 Success

Phase-1 is successful when the Lunar Cave Scout demonstrates disciplined free-flight, usable sensing, credible communications chaining, practical breadcrumb deployment, engineered graceful failure, honest vertical doctrine, and coherent truth across simulation, structured testing, and analog environments — proving the concept is real enough to justify further development.
