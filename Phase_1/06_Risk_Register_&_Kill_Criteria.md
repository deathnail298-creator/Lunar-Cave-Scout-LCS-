06 — Risk Register & Kill Criteria

Lunar Cave Scout (LCS) — Phase 1

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines:

the major risks to the Lunar Cave Scout concept,

the Phase-1 lens for evaluating them,

and the explicit kill criteria that determine when intellectual honesty requires stopping or reframing the project.

Phase-1 is not hype.
Phase-1 is truth discovery.

If the truth is uncomfortable, maturity demands acknowledging it.

2. Philosophy of Risk Management

Phase-1 follows three rules:

1️⃣ We do not negotiate with physics.
If reality says “no,” we listen.

2️⃣ We do not rationalize structural weakness.
If risk is a design issue, we fix it.
If risk is a doctrine issue, we adapt it.
If risk is existential, we stop.

3️⃣ Failure is not shameful — denial is.
A responsibly killed program is success, not defeat.

Phase-1 will not:

bury findings,

massage inconvenient results,

or dress structural flaws as “to be improved later.”

Integrity matters.

3. Phase-1 Risk Register

This section identifies the major risk categories Phase-1 must evaluate honestly.

These risks exist whether we acknowledge them or not.
Phase-1 simply refuses to pretend otherwise.

Risk 1 — Free-Flight Instability Risk

If LCS cannot:

hover credibly,

move slowly without chaos,

or avoid environmental collision predictably,

then the concept is threatened.
This is addressed in 03A.

Indicators of Emerging Risk

persistent oscillation

inability to stabilize at low speeds

repeated unintentional surface contact

cascading instability from minor disturbances

Risk 2 — Perception & Mapping Failure Risk

If sensing:

cannot perceive enough,

cannot maintain meaningful mapping coherence,

depends on unrealistic feature richness,

or collapses in darkness or irregular geometry,

then disciplined behavior is impossible.
This is addressed in 03B.

Indicators of Emerging Risk

frequent collision near unseen geometry

mapping drift beyond operable tolerance

sensing blind spots that cannot be mitigated

complete operational dependence on visual richness

Risk 3 — Communications Fragility Risk

If the breadcrumb chain:

cannot realistically maintain useful connectivity,

collapses too easily,

requires unrealistic repeater density,

or provides no meaningful operational advantage,

then doctrine is fantasy.
This is addressed in 03C.

Indicators of Emerging Risk

frequent total comms death

binary “works / doesn’t work” behavior

impractical number of repeaters required

near-zero tolerance to geometry reality

Risk 4 — Breadcrumb Deployment Feasibility Risk

If LCS cannot:

deploy repeaters safely,

maintain stability during deployment,

place them realistically in constrained spaces,

then the comms doctrine has no physical spine.
This is addressed in 03D.

Indicators of Emerging Risk

repeated instability during deployment

deployment requiring unrealistic precision

unacceptable mission delays

geometry preventing usable deployment

Risk 5 — Failure & Termination Discipline Risk

If LCS:

cannot detect its own degradation,

fails chaotically,

destroys mission value when degraded,

or cannot terminate cleanly,

then it cannot be trusted operationally.
This is addressed in 03E.

Indicators of Emerging Risk

uncontrolled crash behavior

inconsistent shutdown

total data loss under stress

cascading failures affecting broader systems

Risk 6 — Vertical Environment Risk

If vertical environments:

routinely break sensing,

routinely destroy comms,

create uncontrolled behavior,

or cannot be handled with discipline,

then doctrine must prohibit them.
This is addressed in 04.

Indicators of Emerging Risk

unreliable detection of vertical features

repeated collapse of control when descending

comms failure as soon as descent begins

inability to stabilize near vertical thresholds

Risk 7 — Testing Environment Credibility Risk

If:

simulation lies,

structured tests are too easy,

analog tests contradict everything,

then Phase-1 cannot draw responsible conclusions.
This is addressed in 05.

Indicators of Emerging Risk

structured success + analog collapse

simulation confidence unsupported by physical evidence

repeated “we think it works but can’t prove it” outcomes

4. Kill Criteria Philosophy

Kill criteria exist for one reason:

To prevent ego, momentum, or sunk-cost bias from forcing a bad idea forward.

Phase-1 will not:

invent clever wording to avoid saying “this doesn’t work”

postpone existential problems to Phase-2

treat structural impossibility as “engineering refinement needed”

Kill criteria are not threats.
They are safety rails for intellectual honesty.

5. Explicit Phase-1 Kill Criteria

Phase-1 introduces three kill categories:

Engineering Kill

Doctrine Kill

Concept Kill

Each is locked below.

Engineering Kill Criteria (Fixable, Phase-1 Can Continue)

Phase-1 triggers an Engineering Kill if:

a behavior fails due to immaturity rather than impossibility

tuning, component selection, or refinement can plausibly address it

Phase-1 can continue after corrective iteration

Examples:

poor tuning causes instability

early sensing architecture underperforms but improves with iteration

comms works inconsistently but clearly improves with design refinement

Engineering Kills pause, fix, resume.

Doctrine Kill Criteria (Concept Survives, Scope Changes)

Phase-1 triggers a Doctrine Kill if:

the concept remains viable,

but a doctrine pillar proves unrealistic,

and must be formally rewritten.

Examples:

vertical exploration deemed irresponsible → doctrine forbids it

repeater density requirement is too high → doctrine shifts strategy

some environments are explicitly declared out-of-scope

Doctrine Kills redefine identity honestly rather than pretending.

Concept Kill Criteria (Stop)

Phase-1 will declare a Concept Kill if any of the following are proven true:

1️⃣ LCS cannot demonstrate slow, controlled, stable free-flight without relying on environmental contact.

2️⃣ Environment sensing cannot produce reliable, actionable geometry awareness in realistic conditions.

3️⃣ Breadcrumb comms chaining cannot realistically maintain useful connectivity in relevant analog environments.

4️⃣ Breadcrumb deployment repeatedly destabilizes flight or is operationally impractical.

5️⃣ Failure behavior is persistently chaotic, destructive, or uncontrolled.

6️⃣ Vertical environments are proven fundamentally incompatible with responsible operation AND vertical environments are required for mission justification.

7️⃣ Testing environments prove we cannot trust our own results to justify Phase-2.

If one or more of these conditions are met with credible evidence,
continuing forward would be irresponsible.

Phase-1 must have the courage to say “no.”

6. Evidence Standard for Kill Decisions

A kill decision requires:

repeatable failures OR

one catastrophic failure demonstrating unsafe architecture

disciplined analysis

no credible engineering path to correction (for Concept Kills)

honest documentation

Kill decisions must be made:

unemotionally

transparently

deliberately

Phase-1 is not about winning.
It is about truth.

7. Governance & Accountability

Kill decisions require:

formal review

documentation

supporting test evidence

coherence with Phase-1 doctrine

The correct outcome is:

move forward confidently
or

stop proudly because we respected reality

Either outcome is honorable.

8. Boundaries & Non-Claims
Locked in This Document

risks are acknowledged explicitly

kill criteria exist and will be honored

program integrity outweighs optimism

Phase-1 is allowed to end with “no”

Not Claimed

This document does not:

predict failure

predict success

establish legal program governance

define Phase-2 resource plans

Those belong to later stages.

9. Single-Sentence Summary

Phase-1 maintains a disciplined risk register and explicit kill criteria to ensure that the Lunar Cave Scout advances only if reality supports it — and to guarantee we have the maturity to stop if it does not.
